Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to create a team profile generator for the user to easily create a team profile catalogue. 

Usage/Steps:

1. In command line, navigate to /Develop and run "npm init -y"
2. In package.json -> Change "test" value to "jest"
3. In command line, install Inquirer@8
4. Navigate to index.js and run "node index.js"
5. Follow the prompts and answer the questions accordingly
6. When finished, click "I am done" and the html will be generated with the title of "theTeam.html"

Lessons Learned:

I learned how to create tests and use them as a guide to create a working code. I also learned how to make more files and file types work together to create a new file in a way that I had never done before. 

I learned just how flexible and adaptable some of the template-literals can be.
